## Overview
The **Social Security Claiming Simulator** is a tool designed to help individuals explore how the age at which they claim Social Security retirement benefits might affect their monthly payments and overall lifetime benefits (given certain assumptions). By modeling various claim ages and comparing potential outcomes, users can gain insights into different strategies for optimizing retirement income.

> **Note**: The results are based on user inputs, built-in assumptions, and simplifications. Real-world outcomes may differ due to inflation, legislative changes, and other factors not modeled here.

---

## Features
- **Multiple Claiming Age Comparisons**: Easily compare benefits if claimed at different ages (e.g., 62, full retirement age, 70).  
- **Lifetime Projection**: Estimate how lifetime benefits may vary depending on claim age assumptions.  
- **Parameter Adjustments**: Modify assumptions such as annual cost-of-living adjustments (COLA), discount rates, mortality assumptions, and more.  
- **Interactive Analysis**: (If applicable) Some parts of the simulator may be interactive, allowing you to tweak inputs on the fly.

## Getting Started

### Requirements
- Python 3.7+ (If this is a Python project)
- A terminal or command prompt to run commands
- (Optional) A virtual environment tool like `venv` or `conda` for Python dependency management

### Installation
1. Clone or download the repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/jtayl222/social-security-claiming-simulator.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd social-security-claiming-simulator
   ```
3. (Optional) Create and activate a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate   # On macOS/Linux
   # or
   venv\Scripts\activate      # On Windows
   ```
4. Install required dependencies (if a `requirements.txt` file is provided):
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### Running the Program
1. In the project directory, run the main Python script or the entry point of the simulator. (Example command below—adapt as necessary if your file structure is different):
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```
2. Follow the on-screen instructions to input the required parameters (e.g., current age, assumed retirement age, expected COLA, etc.).

---

## Usage
- After running the simulator, you may be prompted to enter personal assumptions such as:
  - **Current Age**  
  - **Desired Claiming Age**  
  - **Expected Annual COLA**  
  - **Life Expectancy**  

- The program will then compute estimated monthly benefits and cumulative lifetime benefits based on these inputs, often presenting comparisons across multiple scenarios.

- **Important**: The simulator is meant for exploration only. If any parameter or calculation is unclear, review the source code or consult with a professional.

## Developer Instructions

### Cloning the Repository
If you plan to modify or extend the simulator, clone the repo:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/jtayl222/social-security-claiming-simulator.git
cd social-security-claiming-simulator
```

### Running Locally
1. Set up a Python 3 environment (virtual environments are recommended).
2. Install dependencies with:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Run the main Python script:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```
4. Modify existing source files or create new modules to add features, fix bugs, or improve performance.
